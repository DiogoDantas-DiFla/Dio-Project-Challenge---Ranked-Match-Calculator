# DIO Project Challenge - Ranked Match Calculator

This repository is a "Project Challenge" of the bootcamp "Potência Tech iFood - Programação do Zero" promoted by the courses and bootcamps website Digital Innovation One (DIO) with the aim of enabling students of this bootcamp to have a solid foundation in Programming Logic.

Regardless of the area of activity that a programmer will pursue, it is necessary to learn Programming Logic even if the programmer already programs in a Programming Language such as C, Java, Python, etc, since Programming Logic will reinforce its base.

The idea of this challenge is to create a program, no matter the programming language (I picked Java for this challenge), where the user inserts the amount of wins and defeats of a Hero and the program displays the ranking of the hero in a pop-up window. The catch here is to use a function, AKA method, to process the hero's ranking.

## Prerequisites for running the project
- JDK 8+ (I'm using JDK 17)
- IDE for Java development (I'm using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition version 2023.3.5)
